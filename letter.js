 //The Letter constructor should define:

  //* A string value to store the underlying character for the letter

  //* A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet

  //* A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed

  //* A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correct
